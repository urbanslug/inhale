Small docker image to use in places such as CI to compile and test clojurescript apps

Recommended for use with [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs) and projects that look something like [sniff](https://gitlab.com/urbanslug/sniff).

Chromium dep is for headless browser you may need during your tests.
